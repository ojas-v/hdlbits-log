/*
When designing circuits, you must think first in terms of circuits:

I want this logic gate
I want a combinational blob of logic that has these inputs and produces these outputs
I want a combinational blob of logic followed by a set of flip-flops
What you must not do is write the code first, then hope it generates a proper circuit.

If (cpu_overheated) then shut_off_computer = 1;
If (~arrived) then keep_driving = ~gas_tank_empty;
Syntactically-correct code does not necessarily result in a reasonable circuit (combinational logic + flip-flops). The usual reason is: "What happens in the cases other than those you specified?". Verilog's answer is: Keep the outputs unchanged.

This behaviour of "keep outputs unchanged" means the current state needs to be remembered, and thus produces a latch. Combinational logic (e.g., logic gates) cannot remember any state. Watch out for Warning (10240): ... inferring latch(es)" messages. Unless the latch was intentional, it almost always indicates a bug. Combinational circuits must have a value assigned to all outputs under all conditions. This usually means you always need else clauses or a default value assigned to the outputs.

Demonstration
The following code contains incorrect behaviour that creates a latch. Fix the bugs so that you will shut off the computer only if it's really overheated, and stop driving if you've arrived at your destination or you need to refuel.




This is the circuit described by the code, not the circuit you want to build.
always @(*) begin
    if (cpu_overheated)
       shut_off_computer = 1;
end

always @(*) begin
    if (~arrived)
       keep_driving = ~gas_tank_empty;
end
